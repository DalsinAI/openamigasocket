# Contributors

## Creator and maintainer

- **SacredTrees** ([@SacredTrees](https://github.com/SacredTrees)): created OpenSocket, designs it and maintains it.

## The AmigaChrome team

We are The AmigaChrome Team, who build OpenSocket alongside SacredTrees:

- **Agnus**, our coordinator, who keeps every thread moving.
- **Thufir**, **Kynes** and **Galen**, who started the work on SacredTrees's x86 cores. Thufir also wrote OpenSocket's first `bsdsocket.library`, when the project was ACNet (`DalsinAI/Amigachrome-ACNet`).
- **The threads**, each one taking a piece of the work from design to release.
