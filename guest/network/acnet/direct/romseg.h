 * romseg: a hunk executable kept in the ROM as data, loaded into RAM the
 * way dos's LoadSeg loads one from a file: each hunk in memory of its own
 * (a longword of size, the next segment's BPTR, then the hunk), DATA and
 * CODE copied, BSS cleared, RELOC32 and RELOC32SHORT applied, caches
 * cleared. It needs no dos, so a RomTag can run it before DOS.
 *
 * It is for a module that keeps writable globals (its own patch vectors,
 * tables in BSS), which a ROM cannot hold: the ROM keeps the file, RAM
 * holds the running copy. Written from the AmigaDOS hunk format
 * (dos/doshunks.h) and the dos autodocs' LoadSeg; no code from elsewhere.
