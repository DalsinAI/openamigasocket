/* OpenSocketDirect: OpenSocket's own TCP/IP stack (lwIP) over a SANA-II
 * device, as bsdsocket.library's Direct backend sees it.
 *
 * The stack keeps writable globals (lwIP's), so it is built as a hunk
 * image of its own: bsdsocket.library carries the image as data and loads
 * it into RAM (romseg.c) when the card layer chooses Direct, so the library
 * itself stays ROM-clean. The image's first RomTag (rt_Name
 * "opensocketdirect") points with rt_Init at its struct DirectOps.
 * MIT. */
